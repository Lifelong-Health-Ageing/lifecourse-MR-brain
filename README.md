# lifecourse-MR-brain
Scripts written for manuscript employing a two-sample multivariable lifecourse Mendelian Randomization approach in UK Biobank (UKB) to investigate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on midlife brain structure. Secondary analyses assessing similar brain traits in childhood were conducted in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD).

This project has been my first foray into MR as well as the first time I have used R and Bash to conduct analyses, so I'm well aware that the way I've approached the much of the coding is probably a bit long-winded and clunky. Hopefully this will refine further with future projects...

Paper shortly to be submitted for peer review and page will be updated once it is eventually accpeted and published somewhere.
